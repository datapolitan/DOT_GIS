# Why Do We Create Maps?

---

class:center,middle
# Types of Maps

---

# General Reference Maps

--

+ Show important physical features of an area
--

+ Include natural and man-made features
--

+ Usually meant to help aid in the navigation or discovery of locations
--

+ Usually fairly simple
--

+ Can be stylized based on the intended audience (tourists vs locals)

# Thematic Maps

--

+ Focuses on a specific theme or subject area
--

+ Features on the map represent the phenomenon being mapped
--

+ Spatial features used for reference

# How do we make maps?

---

# Geographic Information System (GIS)
> Any system for capturing, storing, checking, and displaying data related to positions on the Earth's surface

+ [National Geographic Education Encyclopedia](http://education.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/geographic-information-system-gis/)

---

# Or more simply

> In a GIS, you connect _**data**_ with _**geography**_.

+ [GISgeography.com](http://gisgeography.com/what-gis-geographic-information-systems/)

---

# Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
--

+ Create interactive queries (user-created searches)
--

+ Analyze spatial information
--

+ Edit data in maps
--

+ Present the results of all these operations

---

# Basic Map Using QGIS

---

# QGIS - The Good
--

+ Freely available desktop application
--

+ Lots of features
--

+ Works with different data types
--

+ A strong community developing new features and plug-ins

---

# QGIS - The Bad
--

+ A bit bug-y sometimes
--

+ Visual style is a little clunky
--

+ Features change between versions
--

+ It will crash (but so will ArcGIS)

---

# QGIS - The Bug-y
--

+ Sometimes things get jumbled -> zoom out then zoom back in
--

+ Things don't work properly -> close and restart
--

+ Other problems that we'll find in class

---

# Shapefiles
--
        
+ Basic file for storing map elements
--

+ Stores spatial data, like points, lines, and polygons
--

+ Multiple files comprise a "shapefile"

--

![img-center-80](images/file_struct1.png)

---

# Shapefiles

![img-center-80](images/file_struct1.png)
--

+ .shp—The main file that stores the feature geometry
--

+ .dbf—The dBASE table that stores the attribute information of features

---

# Shapefiles

![img-center-80](images/file_struct1.png)

+ .prj—The file that stores the coordinate system information
--

+ .shx—The index file that stores the index of the feature geometry

---

# You might also see
--

+ .cpg—Identifies the character set to be used
--

+ .sbn and .sbx—The files that store the spatial index of the features

---

# Shapefiles

+ Have a few limitations
--

+ One geometry type (Point, Line, Polygon) per shapefile
--

+ So sometimes you end up with this:
![img](images/file_struct2.png)

---

# Shapefiles
--

+ Column names can only be letters, numbers, and underscores "_"
--

+ Column names can only be ten characters long

# Projections
--

+ No one's favorite part of GIS
--

+ But a necessary part of it nonetheless
--

+ Convert points on the 3-dimensional Earth (**latitude** and **longitude**) to x and y coordinates on a 2-dimensional map

+ Every projection distorts some part of your map

# Projections Matter
![img-full](images/projections.png)

# Projections

+ For the most part we will work in **WGS 84** (latitude and longitude)
--

+ In NYC, we use a more accurate projection **NY State Plane/Long Island Zone**
![img-right-60](images/projections_NYSplane.png)

###### Source: https://alidade.wikispaces.com/New+York+SPCS+Zones
---

# Projections
+ Identified by unique IDs that make it easier to talk about them
--

+ WGS 84 is referred to as **EPSG:4326**
--

+ State Plane Long Island is referred to as **EPSG:2263**

# Base Maps
![img-full](images/map1.png)
#### Image Source: http://www.geocontrolling.com/co-je-gis.htm
---

# Base Maps
![img-center-80](images/basemap1.png)

---

# Base Maps
--
       
+ Adding base maps will give your map context
--

+ In QGIS, you need a plugin to use base maps
--

+ There are several, but we're only going to use one of them

---

# Base Map Plugin
+ From the Plugins menu, select "Manage and Install Plugins"

![img-center-60](images/basemap2.png)

---

# Base Map Plugin

+ Search for the QuickMapServices plugin and install it

![img-center-75](images/basemap3_box.png)

---

# Setting Up QuickMapServices Plugin
+ Go to the Settings Menu
![img-center-80](images/basemap4.png)

---

# Setting Up QuickMapServices Plugin
+ Get the contributed packs
![img-center-80](images/basemap5_box.png)

---

# Setting Up QuickMapServices Plugin
+ Revel in all the beautiful base maps
![img-right-30](images/basemap6.png)

---

# Choosing a Base Map
--

+ Think about what someone reading your map needs to see for context
--

+ Think about how the base map interacts with the data on your map

---

# Base Maps - Hierarchy
--

+ If your data is the most important part of the map, make sure it looks more important than the base map
--

+ Avoid base maps that strongly emphasize features that aren't relevant on your map

---

# Base Maps - Colors
--

+ Choose base maps with colors that complement the colors on your map
--

+ The contrast between the color on your map and the color on the base map should be enough to make your layers clearly visible

---

# Base Maps - Scale

![img-center-55](images/scale.jpg)

#### Source: http://go.owu.edu/~jbkrygie/krygier_html/geog_222/geog_222_lo/geog_222_lo04.html

---

# Base Maps - Scale
+ Base maps show different levels of detail at different scales
--

+ Make sure the level of detail is appropriate to your map

---

# Scale

# Scale

![img-center-80](images/scale-basemap-denver.png)

# Proprietary vs Open Source Software
--

+ Proprietary software source code is owned by an individual or an organization and tightly restricted (usually for profit)
--

+ Open source software source code is freely available to anyone for download, alteration, and republishing

---

# Proprietary vs Open Source Software

--

+ Proprietary software code is generally supported by a team of paid professionals working for the organization that owns the code
--

+ Open source software code is generally supported by a mix of paid and volunteer professionals that contribute changes back to the community
---

# Proprietary vs Open Source Software
--

+ Proprietary software is often available only by purchasing a license
--

+ Open source software is free to use though there generally a license that specifies the restrictions (if any) on its use and reuse
--

+ Companies using open source software may charge for the use of the software through their proprietary implementations or via their infrastructure

# A Few Things We Didn't Talk About
--

+ Normalizing data for choropleths ([see this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RvSxNcafU))
--

+ Buffering features
--

+ Geocoding
--

+ Spatial databases
--

+ Other spatial data types (KML, GeoJSON, GeoTIFF)
--

+ Editing data

---

# QGIS - The Good
--

+ Open-source software that’s freely available
--

+ Works with lots of different data types, including shapefiles, KML (Google Earth), GeoJSON, and text files
--

+ Works with various spatial databases
--

+ Strong community developing features and plug-ins
---

# QGIS - The Bad
--

+ Not an enterprise software like ESRI ArcGIS
--

+ The visual style is a little clunky
--

+ Features tend to change between versions (moving around, menu option changes, etc) 
--

+ Major versions tend to have major feature changes
--

+ Plug-ins tend not to work with newer versions
--

+ And it crashes (as you've probably already experienced)

---

# And of course...

---

# QGIS - The Bug-y
--

+ Projects with different CRS layers tend to get misaligned when zooming
--

+ _Zoom in and then back out to fix_
--

+ Google base maps tend not to appear on load
--

+ _Have to zoom in to get them to appear_
--

+ Other odd behavior that they’re hopefully working on
--

+ _File them here: https://hub.qgis.org/wiki/17/Bugreports_

# Reminders
--

+ Know your layer CRS
--

+ When in doubt, zoom in and then zoom out
--

+ If you’re working with a CSV file and run into an error, export as a shapefile and try it again
--

+ Save your project often
--

+ Choose good file names

---

# Final Thoughts
--

+ Maps are a great way to visualize and explore spatial data
--

+ Some data is only intelligible when mapped
--

+ QGIS is a cheap (as in free) way to get started 
--

+ There are many resources online for how to use QGIS and other GIS applications
--

+ Share what you know with others -> Data wants to be mapped
