#Why Do We Create Maps?

---

class:center,middle
#Types of Maps

---

#General Reference Maps

--

+ Show important physical features of an area
--

+ Include natural and man-made features
--

+ Usually meant to help aid in the navigation or discovery of locations
--

+ Usually fairly simple
--

+ Can be stylized based on the intended audience (tourists vs locals)

---

---

#Thematic Maps

--

+ Focuses on a specific theme or subject area
--

+ Features on the map represent the phenomenon being mapped
--

+ Spatial features used for reference

#How do we make maps?

---

#Geographic Information System (GIS)
> Any system for capturing, storing, checking, and displaying data related to positions on the Earth's surface

+ [National Geographic Education Encyclopedia](http://education.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/geographic-information-system-gis/)

---

#Or more simply

> In a GIS, you connect _**data**_ with _**geography**_.

+ [GISgeography.com](http://gisgeography.com/what-gis-geographic-information-systems/)

---

#Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
--

+ Create interactive queries (user-created searches)
--

+ Analyze spatial information
--

+ Edit data in maps
--

+ Present the results of all these operations

---

#Proprietary vs Open Source Software
--

+ Proprietary software source code is owned by an individual or an organization and tightly restricted (usually for profit)
--

+ Open source software source code is freely available to anyone for download, alteration, and republishing

---

#Proprietary vs Open Source Software

--

+ Proprietary software code is generally supported by a team of paid professionals working for the organization that owns the code
--

+ Open source software code is generally supported by a mix of paid and volunteer professionals that contribute changes back to the community
---

#Proprietary vs Open Source Software
--

+ Proprietary software is often available only by purchasing a license
--

+ Open source software is free to use though there generally a license that specifies the restrictions (if any) on its use and reuse
--

+ Companies using open source software may charge for the use of the software through their proprietary implementations or via their infrastructure

---

#QGIS - The Good
--

+ Freely available desktop application
--

+ Lots of features
--

+ Works with different data types
--

+ A strong community developing new features and plug-ins

---

#QGIS - The Bad
--

+ A bit bug-y sometimes
--

+ Visual style is a little clunky
--

+ Features change between versions
--

+ It will crash (but so will ArcGIS)

---

#QGIS - The Bug-y
--

+ Sometimes things get jumbled -> zoom out then zoom back in
--

+ Things don't work properly -> close and restart
--

+ Other problems that we'll find in class

#Layers
![img-full](images/map1.png)

---

#Shapefiles
--
        
+ Basic file for storing map elements
--

+ Stores spatial data, like points, lines, and polygons
--

+ Multiple files comprise a "shapefile"

--

![img-center-80](images/file_struct1.png)

---

#Shapefiles

![img-center-80](images/file_struct1.png)
--

+ .shp—The main file that stores the feature geometry
--

+ .dbf—The dBASE table that stores the attribute information of features

---

#Shapefiles

![img-center-80](images/file_struct1.png)

+ .prj—The file that stores the coordinate system information
--

+ .shx—The index file that stores the index of the feature geometry

---

#You might also see
--

+ .cpg—Identifies the character set to be used
--

+ .sbn and .sbx—The files that store the spatial index of the features

---

# Shapefiles

+ Have a few limitations
--

+ One geometry type (Point, Line, Polygon) per shapefile
--

+ So sometimes you end up with this:
![img](images/file_struct2.png)

---

# Shapefiles
--

+ Column names can only be letters, numbers, and underscores "_"
--

+ Column names can only be ten characters long

# Projections
--

+ No one's favorite part of GIS
--

+ But a necessary part of it nonetheless
--

+ Convert points on the 3-dimensional Earth (**latitude** and **longitude**) to x and y coordinates on a 2-dimensional map

--

![img-center-85](images/projections-orange.jpg)

[Digital Coast Geozone](https://geozoneblog.wordpress.com/2012/05/22/happy-birthday-mercator/)

---

#Projections
+ Every projection distorts some part of your map

![img-center-50](images/projections-faces.png)

[FlowingData](http://flowingdata.com/2014/01/13/map-projections-illustrated-with-a-face/)

---

# Mercator Projections
--

+ A common map projection
--

+ Makes geometries near poles look bigger than geometries near the equator
--

![img-center-50](images/mercator.gif)

---

#Projections Matter
--

+ These circles are all the same size on the globe:

#Projections Matter
![img-full](images/projections.png)

---

#Projections

+ For the most part we will work in **WGS 84** (latitude and longitude)
--

+ But if we need to calculate area or do anything else where we want to talk about **feet** or **meters** we will use a local projection (in NYC this is called **State Plane Long Island**)

![img-center-40](images/projections_NYSplane.png)

---

# Projections
+ Identified by unique IDs that make it easier to talk about them
--

+ WGS 84 is referred to as **EPSG:4326**
--

+ State Plane Long Island is referred to as **EPSG:2263**
--

## Remember these two and you should be set

+ Moving map around -> Adjust with arrows
+ "North" arrow -> need to manually align

---

#Your Turn
+ Working in groups, create a map of DOT 311 Service Requests for the Community Districts in your borough
+ Decide on the colors you want and how you want to represent the values
+ Open print composer and add your map elements
+ Decide on the map elements you want to include (legend, scale, north arrow, etc.)
+ Save your map as a PDF to present it to the class
+ We'll all be available to help as needed
+ Have fun!

#QGIS - The Bad
--

+ Not an enterprise software like ESRI ArcGIS
--

+ The visual style is a little clunky
--

+ Features tend to change between versions (moving around, menu option changes, etc) 
--

+ Major versions tend to have major feature changes
--

+ Plug-ins tend not to work with newer versions
--

+ And it crashes (as you've probably already experienced)

---

#And of course...

#QGIS - The Bug-y
--

+ Projects with different CRS layers tend to get misaligned when zooming
--

+ _Zoom in and then back out to fix_
--

+ Google base maps tend not to appear on load
--

+ _Have to zoom in to get them to appear_
--

+ Other odd behavior that they’re hopefully working on
--

+ _File them here: https://hub.qgis.org/wiki/17/Bugreports_

#Reminders
--

+ Know your layer SRS
--

+ When in doubt, zoom in and then zoom out
--

+ If you’re working with a CSV file and run into an error, export as a shapefile and try it again
--

+ Save your project often
--

+ Choose good file names

---

#Final Thoughts
--

+ Maps are a great way to visualize and explore spatial data
--

+ Some data is only intelligible when mapped
--

+ QGIS is a cheap (as in free) way to get started 
--

+ There are many resources online for how to use QGIS and other GIS applications
--

+ Share what you know with others -> Data wants to be mapped
