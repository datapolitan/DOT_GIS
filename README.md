##Background
The New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) employs over 4,500 people and is responsible for one of the most complex urban transportation networks in the country. Building, maintaining, and improving a network of over 6,000 miles of streets, 12,000 miles of sidewalks, and 789 bridges and tunnels requires a staff trained in the latest tools and techniques for managing and analyzing this data. Central to this work are the various geographic information systems (GIS) with which DOT employees can create, visualize, and analyze spatial data quickly and accurately, communicating critical information to decision makers and members of the public.

While GIS applications are often critical to the task of analysts, they aren’t simple to use and require training before users are able to fully utilize the myriad of features they offer. DOT has made a commitment to explore the use of open source software solutions, a cost-effective way to acquire software that is often free to use and customize, but doesn’t come with the same vendor support proprietary software solutions provide. Users often need training in not only the basics of the particular program they’re using, but an awareness of the various resources available through tutorials, blogs, and other online documentation to support their work. Building proficiency with these systems will enable DOT employees to more fully utilize these valuable tools, accomplishing their important work in a quick, reliable manner.

Demonstrate the process for connecting to a spatial relational database in QGIS
+ Introduce the structured query language (SQL) for querying an open source relational database (PostGIS)
+ Practice writing queries in SQL to accomplish key spatial analytical tasks with real-world data to answer meaningful analytical questions

<a id="intermediate-tlo"></a>
####Terminal Learning Objectives
+ Participants will be familiar with using QGIS to accomplish more sophisticated spatial operations
+ Participants will be familiar with the process for connecting and analyzing data in QGIS stored in a PostGIS spatial database using SQL
+ Participants will be more familiar with key techniques in spatial analysis using SQL
+ Participants will be familiar with sources of technical information and support for using QGIS and PostGIS

<a id="intermediate-aud"></a>
####Key Audience
+ Analysts and other employees with experience analyzing and visualizing spatial data using GIS applications
+ Technology professionals responsible for collecting, processing, and storing spatial data in support of agency operations

<a id="data-vis"></a>
###Data Visualization

<a id="data-vis-sum"></a>
####Summary
A half-day course for up to 20 employees covering the key concepts of how to create truthful and visually-compelling visualizations of important data. The course will cover how to create impactful charts, graphs, and other information visualizations in order to effectively communicate critical analysis to decision-makers, policymakers, and other key stakeholders.

<a id="data-vis-goals"></a>
###Goals
+ Introduce the fundamentals of information visualization design
+ Introduce key terminology as it relates to information visualization design
+ Discuss the application of design principles to the visualization of DOT data

+ Practice creating impactful charts, graphs, and other visualizations to communicate information 

<a id="data-vis-tlo"></a>
###Terminal Learning Objectives
+ Participants will understand the basics of information visualization design
+ Participants will be familiar with key terminology and concepts of information visualization design as they relate to DOT data 
+ Participants will understand how to create meaningful and visually-compelling charts in Excel using DOT data
+ Participants will be practiced in applying the principles of good information visualization design to their work

<a id="data-vis-aud"></a>
###Key Audience
+ Employees of all levels who communicate critical analysis through charts, graphs, or other means of information visualization
+ Employees needing to increase their ability to interpret and understand charts, graphs, and other means of information visualization as part of their work

##Course Structure and Content
Each course will be designed as a collaborative, hands-on, dynamic experience for participants. The Introduction to GIS Fundamentals and Intermediate GIS classes will be one (1) day classes, running from 9 am to 4 pm, with a one (1) hour lunch break. The Data Visualization will be a half-day class, running from 9 am to 1 pm with no lunch break. While the course content will closely follow the outlines above, the actual content for each course will be the responsibility of the course designer and instructor. Any deviations from the above course content will be consistent with creating the relevant and engaging educational environment DOT is seeking for its employees. The DOT Learning Center will be provided draft copies of the materials in advance for their review and input.
